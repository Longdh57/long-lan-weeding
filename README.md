## Download and Installation

- Clone the repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/...`
- Install resource: `$ yarn install`
- Start project on default port 3000: `$ yarn start`

## Usage


### Advanced Usage

Clone the source files of the theme and navigate into the theme's root directory. Run `yarn install` and then run `yarn start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.

#### Yarn Scripts

- `yarn run build` builds the project - this builds assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into `dist`
- `yarn run build:assets` copies the files in the `src/assets/` directory into `dist`
- `yarn run build:pug` compiles the Pug located in the `src/pug/` directory into `dist`
- `yarn run build:scripts` brings the `src/js/scripts.js` file into `dist`
- `yarn run build:scss` compiles the SCSS files located in the `src/scss/` directory into `dist`
- `yarn run clean` deletes the `dist` directory to prepare for rebuilding the project
- `yarn run start:debug` runs the project in debug mode
- `yarn start` or `npm run start` runs the project, launches a live preview in your default browser, and watches for changes made to files in `src`

You must have npm installed in order to use this build environment.
